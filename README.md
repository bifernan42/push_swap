# Project push_swap

## Concepts: [Sorting Algorithms, Stack Manipulation, Algorithm Optimization, Complexity Analysis]  

In this project, we had to:  
- Implement a **sorting algorithm** using **two stacks** (`a` and `b`) and a **restricted set of operations**  
- Develop an **efficient sorting approach** that minimizes the number of moves  
- Handle **invalid inputs**, ensuring no duplicates and only valid integers are used  
- Optimize the sorting process to stay under **700 operations for 100 numbers** and **5500 operations for 500 numbers**  

### Bonus Features:  
- Implemented a **checker program** that verifies if a given sequence of operations correctly sorts the stack  
- Handled **various input formats and errors** gracefully  

This project provided in-depth experience in **algorithmic thinking, stack-based operations, and sorting efficiency optimizations**.
